# MySQL project
Authors: Wooyoung Jeong and Jisu Kim

# Research Questions
1. Find the characteristics of the divided regions based on latitude and longitude.
2. Find statistical characteristics by researching relationship between countries, regions, states, and cities.

# Abstract
In this data set, there is detailed information of each city, state and region with specific latitude. There are 250 countries, 4857 states, and 147400 cities. Based on specific geographical information of many different areas, we decided to dig further to find out specific unique information about areas that are separated by certain longitude and latitude points.
